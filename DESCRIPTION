Description: Bindings to 'libcurl' <https://curl.se/libcurl/> for performing fully
    configurable HTTP/FTP requests where responses can be processed in memory, on
    disk, or streaming via the callback or connection interfaces. Some knowledge
    of 'libcurl' is recommended; for a more-user-friendly web client see the 
    'httr2' package which builds on this package with http specific tools and logic.
