Title: A Connection Interface to Libcurl
Version: 0.5.99
Date: 2015-02-01
Author: Jeroen Ooms
Maintainer: Jeroen Ooms <jeroen.ooms@stat.ucla.edu>
Description: The curl() function provides a drop-in replacement for base url()
    with better performance and support for http 2.0, ssl (https://, ftps://),
    gzip, deflate and other libcurl goodies. This interface is implemented
    using the RConnection API in order to support incremental processing of
    both binary and text streams. If you are looking for a more-user-friendly
    http client, try the RCurl or httr packages instead.
