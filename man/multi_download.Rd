\usage{
multi_download(
  urls,
  destfiles = NULL,
  resume = FALSE,
  progress = FALSE,
  timeout = Inf,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{urls}{vector with files to download}

\item{destfiles}{vector (of equal length as \code{urls}) with paths of output files,
or \code{NULL} to use \link{basename} of urls.}

\item{resume}{if the file already exists, resume the download. Note that this may
change server responses, see details.}

\item{progress}{print download progress information}

\item{timeout}{in seconds, passed to \link{multi_run}}

\item{...}{extra handle options passed to each request \link{new_handle}}
}
\description{
Download multiple requests concurrently, and supports resuming downloads for large
files. This function is based on \code{\link[=multi_run]{multi_run()}} and hence does not error in case any
of the individual requests fail; you should manually inspect the returned results
to check which of the requests were completed successfully.
}
\details{
Upon completion of all requests, this function returns a data frame with results.
The \code{success} column indicates if a request was successfully completed (regardless
of the HTTP status code). If it failed, e.g. due to a networking issue, the error
message is in the \code{error} column. A \code{success} value \code{NA} indicates that the request
was still in progress when the function was interrupted or reached the elapsed
\code{timeout} and perhaps the download can be resumed if the server supports it.

It is also important to inspect the \code{status_code} column to see if any of the
requests were successful but had a non-success HTTP code, and hence the downloaded
file probably contains an error page instead of the requested content. Note that
when you set \code{resume = TRUE} you should expect HTTP-206 or HTTP-416 responses. The
latter could indicate that the file was already downloaded completely, hence there
was no content left to resume from the server.
