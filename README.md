# curl

> A Modern and Flexible Web Client for R

[![CRAN_Status_Badge](http://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/curl)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=curl)
[![CRAN RStudio mirror downloads](http://cranlogs.r-pkg.org/badges/curl)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=curl)

The curl() and curl_download() functions provide highly
configurable drop-in replacements for base url() and download.file() with
better performance, support for encryption (https, ftps), gzip compression,
authentication, and other libcurl goodies. The core of the package implements a
framework for performing fully customized requests where data can be processed
either in memory, on disk, or streaming via the callback or connection
interfaces. Some knowledge of libcurl is recommended; for a more-user-friendly
web client see the 'httr' package which builds on this package with http
specific tools and logic.

## Documentation

About the R package:

 - Vignette: [curl: A Modern and Flexible Web Client for R](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/curl/vignettes/intro.html)

Other resources:

 - [libcurl handle options overview](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/curl_easy_setopt.html) (use with `handle_setopt` in R)

## Hello World

There are three download interfaces (memory, disk and streaming). Always start by setting up a request handle:

```r
library(curl)
h <- new_handle(copypostfields = "moo=moomooo")
handle_setheaders(h,
  "Content-Type" = "text/moo",
  "Cache-Control" = "no-cache",
  "User-Agent" = "A cow"
)
```

Perform request and download response in memory:

```r
# Perform the request
req <- curl_fetch_memory("http://httpbin.org/post", handle = h)

# Show some outputs
parse_headers(req$headers)
cat(rawToChar(req$content))
str(req)
```

Or alternatively, write response to disk:

```r
tmp <- tempfile()
curl_download("https://httpbin.org/post", tmp, handle = h)
readLines(tmp)
```

Or stream response via Connection interface:

```r
con <- curl("https://httpbin.org/post", handle = h)
open(con)

# Get 3 lines
readLines(con, n = 3)

# Get remaining lines and close connection
readLines(con)
close(con)
```

## Installation

Binary packages for __OS-X__ or __Windows__ can be installed directly from CRAN:

```r
install.packages("curl")
```

Installation from source on Linux requires [`libcurl`](https://curl.se/libcurl/). On __Debian__ or __Ubuntu__ use [libcurl4-openssl-dev](https://packages.debian.org/testing/libcurl4-openssl-dev):

```
sudo apt-get install -y libcurl-dev
```

On __Fedora__, __CentOS or RHEL__ use [libcurl-devel](https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/curl):

```
sudo yum install libcurl-devel
````

### MacOS using curl from homebrew

On __MacOS__ libcurl is included with the system, so usually nothing extra is needed. However if you want to build against the very most recent version of libcurl, which also has many extra features enabled (sftp, http2), install [curl from homebrew](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/master/Formula/curl.rb) and then recompile the R package.


```
brew install curl pkg-config
```

You need to set the `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable to help R find the non-default curl, when building from source. Run this in a __clean R session__ which does not have the curl package loaded already:

```r
Sys.setenv(PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/opt/curl/lib/pkgconfig")
install.packages("curl", type = "source")
```

Afterwards confirm the version using `curl::curl_version()`.

## Development version

Because `devtools` and `httr` depend on `curl`, installing with `install_github` does not work well. The easiest way to install the development version of `curl` is a clean R session:

```r
install.packages("https://github.com/jeroen/curl/archive/master.tar.gz", repos = NULL)
```

Of course windows users need [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) to compile from source.
